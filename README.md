# QSD-shop
During my QSD internship, I had the privilege of working on the development of a web application called QSD Shop. This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in utilizing React with TypeScript for the frontend development, along with Laravel PHP for backend. We gained valuable experience in team work, communication GitHub and Trello. 

Description: A webshop application intended for selling a variety of men's, women's, and children's clothing.

Goal: The project goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly technical system that enables an intuitive, fun, and secure online shopping experience. The QSD Shop should work round the clock to deliver complete item-related and order-related information.  Also, online payment has to be enabled.

Types of users: There are three types of authenticated users - admin, moderator, and customer. However, unauthenticated users can use basic application functionalities, which mainly include reviewing webshop items (view, search, filter). An unauthenticated user can even add items to the cart, but in order to perform any additional actions (such as adding to favorites, rating, and placing orders) an unauthenticated user has to register/login.
